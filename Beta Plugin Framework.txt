-------------------------------- BETA PLUGIN FRAMEWORK

or for fixing typos and other mistakes!
:)

-------------------------------- TESTING STAGES OF THE DEVELOPER
1. Steinberg VST3 Validator
2. Pluginval
3. Some DAWs

-------------------------------- CAUTION TO DEVELOPER
Check if your build is compatible with beta tester's setup.

OS
	Windows/Mac/Linux
DAW
	Does it support the plugin features?
Plugin Properties
	VST2/3, Clap etc.
	32bit/64bit

-------------------------------- CAUTION TO BETA TESTER
Always use a brickwall limiter on master bus
in case of unintentional feedback loops and other
bugs that can hurt your ears and damage your gear!

-------------------------------- USING AN EXAMPLE
To test this framework, I will use my own plugin release,
NEL, as an example for the various aspects of beta testing.
NEL is a VST3 plugin with diverse ways to modulate a
feed-forward delay in order to apply vibrato to a signal.
Whenever some testing aspect explains an aspect of NEL it is
marked with "e.g.".

-------------------------------- USER TYPES (not a hierarchy. combinations possible.)
BEGINNER
	Just started music production.
	Has not internalized anything yet.
	Drag types of knobs make a big difference.
	Visibility and good labels.
ROOKIE
	Some years of experience.
	Might not know about scrollwheel- and modifier keys yet.
	e.g. user dials in simple LFOs and randomized modulators.
ADVANCED
	Pretty much every dedicated plugin user.
	e.g. user can combine the output of multiple modulators.
SOUNDDESIGNER
	Elevated interest in crafting individual sounds rather than finishing tracks.
	e.g. user needs to know what audio rate modulation is
DSP NERD
	e.g. user needs to know how the buffer size of a delay relates to the depth parameter
ANALOG GEARHEAD
	Prefers limited plugin features over digital sounds and looks.
MUSIC PRODUCER
	Wants an easy and streamlined workflow. (Quantity > Quality)
MIXING ENGINEER
	Mixes a song.
	e.g. oversampling for a cleaner vibrato-sound on complex signals.
PRE-MASTERING ENGINEER
	Applies finishing touches to a song's master bus.
MASTERING ENGINEER
	Applies finishing touches to a collection of related songs.

-------------------------------- A PLUGIN IS ASSUMED TO HAVE
1. A TARGET AUDIENCE
	Sex
		e.g. undefined
	Age
		e.g. likely >18
	Skill Level
		e.g. rookies
		e.g. sounddesign nerds
		e.g. dsp nerds
	Audio Job
		e.g. beat makers, sounddesigners, mixing engineers
	Passion for digital music
		e.g. high
	Willingness to pay for plugins
		e.g. low or medium
2. FUNCTIONS
	2.1 Technological function(s)
		e.g. have a complex modulation system.
		e.g. have a feed-forward delay.
		e.g. use the modulation system's output to modulate the delay.
	2.2 Musical function(s)
		e.g. add vibrato to a signal.
		e.g. add scratches to a signal.
		e.g. add timing & pitch variations to a signal.
		e.g. phase distort a signal. (Audiorate Mod)
		e.g. add tape-y pitch dropouts.
	2.3 Visionary function(s)
		e.g. promote relevance of vibrato in music.
		e.g. shift people's mindsets on usefulness of different vibrato modulation types.
		e.g. make the swiss army knife of vibrato.
	2.4 Branding function(s)
		e.g. Mrugalla plugins give existing technological ideas a new spin by combining them in new ways.

-------------------------------- TESTING STAGES OF BETA TESTERS
1. FIRST IMPRESSION
	The beta tester is given at least one screenshot
	or a video without audio.

	1.1 How much does the GUI explain itself just from looking at it?
		1.1.1 How obvious is the signal flow?
	1.2 How appealing / aesthetical does the GUI look?
		1.2.1 Does the overall style fit the supposed target audience.
			e.g. Flat interface for digital music producers.
	1.3 How functional does the GUI look?
		Check for unfortunately placed parameters.
		Check for empty / unused spaced.
2. BLIND TEST
	The beta tester is given a plugin built, but no manual or
	explanation of the plugin's function(s).
	
	2.1 How much does the plugin explain itself?
		2.1.1 Which functions are overlooked?
		2.1.2 Does the user find new unexpected functions?
	2.2 How much are the plugin's features being noticed?
		2.1. OVERLOOKED MOSTLY
			e.g. people rarely find the buffersize feature.
			e.g. using more than 1 macro modulator.
			e.g. adjusting the interpolation type.
		2.2 NOTICED RARELY
			e.g. mixing 2 modulators with each other.
			e.g. dialing in macro modulation.
		2.3 NOTICED SOMETIMES
			e.g. different modulation types in drop-down menu.
		2.4 NOTICED A LOT
			e.g. stereo-width, mid/side.
		2.5 ALWAYS USED
			e.g. depth, speed, mix.
3. EXPLAINED TEST
	The user is informed about the plugin's functions,
	but without explaining how to accomplish them.
	e.g. You can use the plugin to add livelyness to a sterile drum part.
	
	3.1 How does the user approach the plugin now?
		3.1.1 In which way(s) is it different?
		3.1.2 In which way(s) is it similiar?
		3.1.3 Does the user succeed to accomplish the plugin function?

4. INFORMED TEST
	The user is told how to accomplish the plugin's functions.
	
	4.1. The user rates how likely it would be that another user accomplishes the functions.

5. STRESS TEST
	The user is told to play around with the plugin in the context of
	some actual practical work (beat, song etc.)
	
	5.1 Find out in which kind of situations the user chooses the plugin.
		5.1.1 If the user decides against it, why?

-------------------------------- TYPES OF DOCUMENTATION

1. VIDEO
	1.1 UNEDITED
		How does the user navigate the plugin interface?
		What does the user's facial expression reveal?
	1.2 EDITED
		Which usecases are highlighted in the video?
2. TEXT
